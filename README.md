# Description
Resuming repo/algorithm : https://github.com/dwang520/SSSC/blob/master/main_script.m from @dwang520 @DiWangLiDAR
According to https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0924271620301180

I only have transcribed from MATLAB -> Python. 
Please, don't dwell on the form. This code is NOT optimized, I only coded it in speed to try in a full Pythonic pipeline.
There are too many loops. The variable names are awful. Again, I just wanted to segment a maize field.
